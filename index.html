					<h1 class="section-header" style="text-align: center; font-size: 32pt;">Digital Literacy Narrative V2</h1>
					<h3 class="section-header-text" style="text-align: center; font-size: 28pt; width: 50%; margin: 0 auto 16px;">My journey through 4662W</h3>
					<h3 class="sub-section-header" style="text-align: center;">Digital Literacy Narrative v1</h3>
					<p class="sub-section-text" style="text-align: left; margin: 32px;">According to CLA, digital literacy is “"the ability to leverage media literacies and knowledge of information and communications technology, and relevant interpersonal skills, to succeed in a digital space. Digital literacy means assessing sources of information, using technologies responsibly, adapting tools to new purposes, and keeping up with the evolving technology landscape.”, and in this first assignment we were required to demonstrate the extent of our digital literacy coming into this class. I was completely inexperienced with every single tool that we were about to learn in the class, and I was nervous. Check out version one of my digital literacy narrative above and you will see that I had an uphill battle ahead of me.</p>
					<h3 class="sub-section-header" style="text-align: center;">Static Site v1 (HTML & CSS) + Hosted static site (Git & Github)</h3>
					<p class="sub-section-text" style="text-align: left; margin: 32px;">My first challenge: build a rudimentary static site with HTML/CSS coded from scratch. It was a big mountain to climb right out of the gate, but I knew that I had the resources to get this done. I started with the LinkedIn Learning videos about the HTML essentials, but that was just to give myself a basic understanding of what I was up against. Tiffani Reardon’s HTML basics helped me start my index.HTML file. I ended up using Sublime because it came highly recommended by my computer nerd friends and I liked the fact that different tags showed up with different colors. That made everything much easier to read. We also had to learn CSS, which was even more complicated than HTML. I felt like I was learning a new language...I guess I was. I leaned heavily on a master list of tags and had to refer to the resources posted by Professor Card every 10 minutes. I would type out a command, save, refresh my static site and hold my breath to see whether it looked the way I intended it to. Most of the time it didn’t, but sometimes I got it right and just kept repeating the process until I had an acceptable amount of content.

					Next, we were tasked with creating a GitHub account and hosting our static sites there. Admittedly, I followed a Youtube video to create my repository and manipulate the settings to get my site up and running. Only….it wasn’t up and running. It was giving me a 404 error. I posted my struggles on the weekly discussion board and Meg came to the rescue with another Youtube video that helped me solve my problem. I can genuinely see myself using Github to host sites in the future.

					<h3 class="sub-section-header" style="text-align: center;">Digital Literacy Narrative v1</h3>
					<p class="sub-section-text" style="text-align: left; margin: 32px;">According to CLA, digital literacy is “"the ability to leverage media literacies and knowledge of information and communications technology, and relevant interpersonal skills, to succeed in a digital space. Digital literacy means assessing sources of information, using technologies responsibly, adapting tools to new purposes, and keeping up with the evolving technology landscape.”, and in this first assignment we were required to demonstrate the extent of our digital literacy coming into this class.

					<h3 class="sub-section-header" style="text-align: center;">Client Project</h3>
					<p class="sub-section-text">This was my favorite project of the semester. The client project consisted of us working in small groups to develop a new website for the local Austin Healey enthusiast’s club. During the beginning stages of the design process, we were introduced to the concept of wireframes. The first wireframe that I posted on the discussion board looked like a Kindergartener's idea of what a website to look like, but it was that sketch that inspired me to build out more polished wireframes. Each group was given the freedom to decide what deliverables they wanted to turn in, and I strongly advocated for wireframing as opposed to trying to build out a functioning website with code. Thankfully, my group members agreed.

					After we had constructed a needs analysis from the initial interview between Daphne and Professor Card, I began learning how to use a popular wireframing tool called Figma. Once I had played around with it enough to get the basic structure of each page down, I really started to have fun with the artistic components of the website. What I ended up with is drastically different than that first sketch I scribbled on a piece of paper. Both are available for viewing at the designated link above</p>
					<h3 class="sub-section-header" style="text-align: center;">Lightweight Docs 2 (with markdown)</h3>
					<p class="sub-section-text" style="text-align: left; margin: 32px;">Lavacon was a really cool component of this class. Watching different experts present on their respective areas of expertise gave me a greater appreciation for the scope of technical communication. I ended up writing about Scott Youngblom’s presentation about augmented reality’s applications in the field of instructional design. Surprisingly, it turns out that Scott also works with my dad (who is also named Scott) to implement augmented reality into his training program. Anyways, I used the template posted on Canvas to translate my notes into my final deliverable in Markdown.</p>
					<h3 class="sub-section-header" style="text-align: center;">Structured Authoring with DITA</h3>
					<p class="sub-section-text">I was slightly familiar with DITA before encountering it in this class. My WRIT 1001 professor talked about it a lot, and she emphasised to the class that we would eventually need to learn XML. It was easier for me to understand DITA because it came with an editing environment that generated different templates for me. All I had to do was focus on how I wanted to structure my Dita map, and subsequently create the content for each page</p>

					<h3 class="sub-section-header" style="text-align: center;">Static Website v2 & Digital Literacy Narrative v2</h3>
					<p class="sub-section-text" style="text-align: left; margin: 32px;">You’re looking at it! This website is version two of my static site. It is much more developed than my first attempt...that link is above if you really want to see it again. This time, we were allowed to use a template, which was so much easier than having to look up all my tags. I just swapped the content on the template with my own content and deleted parts of the template that I didn’t want to use. My end product is infinitely more simplistic than what the template looked like when I downloaded it, but it’s functional and I call that a win. 

					There were still challenges, like figuring out how to integrate downloadable PDFs. There were also complications when I tried to host the site on GitHub because my pathways were all mixed up, but that’s to be expected when I hardly have any idea what I’m doing. Here I am, writing version two of my digital literacy narrative to prove how far I’ve come. 
					</p>
					<h3 class="sub-section-header" style="text-align: center;">Discussion Boards</h3>
					<p class="sub-section-text">Throughout the semester, I’ve been able to see what my peers are up to via weekly discussion boards. It was a place for us to talk about our progress and share our frustrations as well as our triumphs. As sad as this is to say, it was relieving to see that I was not the only one struggling with a lot of the concepts. Seeing everyone else continue to push forward is what inspired me to keep going. We helped each other out when we felt that we could contribute, and I benefited tremendously from suggestions made by my classmates. 

					As a final note, I would like to acknowledge that I am thankful for the opportunity to learn the skills that I was taught in this class. I know that the field of technical communication is demanding that graduates have experience with  front end development, and that I am a slightly more competitive candidate for the jobs I will soon be applying for. This was one of the hardest classes that I’ve encountered so far in college, but now that I survived I know it was worth it. </p>
